# Issues

- Cannot seek video or pause video in Chrome. The problem is that it only works when the server understands partial content requests (related: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8088364/html5-video-will-not-loop/9549404#9549404).
- Should probably pause other videos when video starts playing. Maybe it should also collapse other comments. Not sure.
- TODO: Better error handling (modal instead of replacing text)
- TODO: CSS skeleton while loading
- TODO: handle request timeout when video doesn't load
